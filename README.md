# What is a sorting algorithm :question:

In computer science, a sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order. For instance,
if you have the set of elements `[5,4,3,2,1]` you could use a sorting algorithm to order this list as `[1,2,3,4,5]`.

# Supported Algorithms

:white_check_mark: Bubble sort algorithm ([Go to implementation](https://github.com/awesome-php-code/sorting-algorithms/blob/main/src/BubbleSort.php)).

# :books: Usage

## Bubble Sort algorithm

```php
use AwesomePhpCode\SortingAlgorithms\BubbleSort;

// [1,2,3,4,5]
$ordered = BubbleSort::sort([5,4,3,2,1]);
```
